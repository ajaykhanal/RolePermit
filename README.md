# RolePermit
Here , there are 3 main roles which are admin, writer and user. The project is overall based on Roles and Permissions. 
So, i am using Spatie Package provided by Laravel for  Roles and Permissions. 
Hence, Writer can create post.
Admin can view all the posts, roles, permissions and users. Admin can change their roles as well. 
User can view his/her profile, can update his/her profile, can change password and view all the posts created by writer.
These all things can do admin dynamically from this dashboard. 
    In Permission section , user can view the post title , post tags and post creater name. But User can't edit or delete posts.This permission
    is added in this web application.  Admin can give permissions as he want. So that, it changes in the web based applications dynamically from the 
    dashboard.
